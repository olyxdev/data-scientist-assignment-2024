# OLYX Data Scientist Take-Home Assignment

## Introduction
This take-home assignment is designed to assess your ability to explore a dataset, analyze it, and generate actionable insights through data storytelling. We encourage you to be creative and apply your data science skills to a real-world challenge that reflects our focus on renewable energy, sustainable development, and informed decision-making. We recommend spending no longer than four hours on the assignment.

## The Dataset
We are providing you with a dataset related to global energy statistics, covering various aspects of energy consumption, access to electricity, CO2 emissions, renewable energy generation, and financial aid for clean energy projects. The dataset contains the following features:

- `Entity`: The name of the country or region.
- `Year`: Data from 2000 to 2020.
- `Access to electricity (% of population)`: Population percentage with electricity access.
- `Access to clean fuels for cooking (% of population)`: Population relying on clean cooking fuels.
- `Renewable-electricity-generating-capacity-per-capita`: Installed renewable energy capacity per person.
- `Financial flows to developing countries (US $)`: Aid for clean energy projects.
- `Renewable energy share in total final energy consumption (%)`: Share of renewables in energy consumption.
- `Electricity from fossil fuels (TWh)`: Fossil fuel-generated electricity.
- `Electricity from nuclear (TWh)`: Nuclear power-generated electricity.
- `Electricity from renewables (TWh)`: Renewable energy electricity generation.
- `Low-carbon electricity (% electricity)`: Electricity from low-carbon sources.
- `Primary energy consumption per capita (kWh/person)`: Energy consumption per person.
- `Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/$2011 PPP GDP)`: Energy use per GDP unit.
- `Value_co2_emissions (metric tons per capita)`: CO2 emissions per capita.
- `Renewables (% equivalent primary energy)`: Share of renewable energy in primary energy.
- `GDP growth (annual %)`: Annual GDP growth rate.
- `GDP per capita`: GDP per person.
- `Density (P/Km2)`: Population density.
- `Land Area (Km2)`: Total land area.
- `Latitude`: Latitude of the country’s centroid.
- `Longitude`: Longitude of the country’s centroid.

## Your Task
Using the dataset provided, your task is to explore the data and produce meaningful insights. You are encouraged to:
- Formulate questions that interest you and try to answer them with the data. For example:
    - Compare energy consumption across regions and assess the potential for renewable energy investment
    - Predict energy consumption and/or future energy usage for planning and policy-making
- Apply data science best practices, such as exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, transformation, and visualization.
- Use statistical analysis and modeling techniques where appropriate to generate deeper insights.
- Communicate your findings through well-documented code and meaningful visualizations.

## Submission Guidelines
If you have any questions while working on the assignment, feel free to contact us at `data[at]olyx.nl`. 

Please push your code to a **private** GitHub repository and share access with the user `charlesdupont23`. 

Below are some additional guidelines and expectations for the submission:
- You should submit a Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) containing all of the code used in your analysis.
- Include explanations and commentary in your notebook where relevant, as if you were explaining your process and findings to a stakeholder unfamiliar with the technical details.
- Feel free to use any external libraries or tools to enhance your analysis and visualization.
- Your notebook should be well-organized, readable, and include the following:
    - A short introduction explaining your approach and methodology
    - One or more sections presenting your analysis, visualizations, and insights.
    - A brief conclusion summarizing your findings.

**We hope you enjoy working on the assignment and wish you good luck!**
